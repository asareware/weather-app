# Weather App (Template)

Bootstrap-based template for Aj Weather App. It includes a search bar, a day/night photo preview area, and stacked text for city, country, weather, and time. The form is intentionally not wired to an API so you can drop in your own data later.

## Project structure
- `index.html` — Bootstrap quick-start markup and the weather card template.
- `styles.css` — light custom styling for the hero image area and layout.
- `scripts/app.js` — client-side template logic to show placeholder city info and swap day/night photos based on the visitor’s clock.
- `scripts/forecast.js` — legacy mock forecast helper (not used in the template) that you can repurpose or remove.

## Quick start
1) Open `index.html` in your browser (or serve locally with `python -m http.server`) to see the template preview.
2) Replace the placeholder text and image logic in `scripts/app.js` with your real weather and imagery data sources when ready.
